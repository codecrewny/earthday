      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>As early as the 1940s, a dense haze menacingly hovered over Los Angeles. It took scientists a few years before they discovered that vehicles were the culprit of the city's prevalent air pollution. For decades, the citizens of LA suffered from the exposure to dangerous chemicals, such as carbon monoxide, and by the early 2000s the rates of childhood asthma was 14% compared to the national average of 10%.</p>
      <p>When the population of Los Angeles increased and urban sprawl transformed the landscape of the coastal basin, the dependency on the automobile as the main form of transportation also escalated. Los Angeles became even more at risk to air pollution. In order to address this rapidly growing issue, the state of California has passed several laws and regulations; a series of proactive steps taken after the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.  And over the time, the skyline has become more defined and the air more safer to breathe.</p>

      <h2>California Air Resources Board (CARB)</h2>

      <p>The California Legislature established the Air Resources Board with the goals of attaining and maintaining clean air, researching the causes of air pollution,  and solving the issues caused by motor vehicles. Since it was established prior to the federal Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to have its own environmental regulatory agency.</p>

      <h2>Nation's last recorded Stage 3 Smog Alert</h2>

      <p>Governor Ronald Reagan urged residents to "limit all but absolutely necessary auto travel". Schools were routinely shut down during the smog alert days. To put the smog levels into perspective, and Stage 3 smog alert during this era would be equivalent to a Stage 1 alert today.</p>

      <h2>California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)</h2>

      <p>This statute was passed shortly after the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). CEQA mandates an environmental analysis before projects can be approved. Throughout the past four decades, CEQA has saved both natural landscapes and historical monuments throughout the state of California. It also insures that the public is engaged in such decisions that could impact their environment.</p>

      <h2>Cleaning burning gasoline comes into market</h2>

      <p>After the ARB approved standards for cleaner burning gasoline and low/zero emission vehicles, cleaning burning gasoline came to market. Oxygenates became a required additive in gasoline, and as a result, carbon monoxide emissions were cut by 10%.</p>

    <div class="slide animated" id="slide9" year="1996" style="display: none">

      <h2>Automakers and Zero Emission Vehicles</h2>

      <p>This mandate passed by the California Air Resources Board mandated the seven major automobile suppliers in the US to commit to selling Zero Emission Vehicles. Companies, such as GM, manufactured cars that were to be specifically leased to residents of Los Angeles. </p>
