      <p>
        The California Legislature established the Air Resources Board with the goals of attaining and maintaining clean air, researching the causes of air pollution,  and solving the issues caused by motor vehicles. Since it was established prior to the federal Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to have its own environmental regulatory agency.

        This statute was passed shortly after the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). CEQA mandates an environmental analysis before projects can be approved. Throughout the past four decades, CEQA has saved both natural landscapes and historical monuments throughout the state of California. It also insures that the public is engaged in such decisions that could impact their environment.
